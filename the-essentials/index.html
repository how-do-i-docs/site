            <h1>The Essentials</h1>
            <p>Before we get started on this documentation journey, we need a basic understanding of what documentation <i>is</i>, and why we care about it.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What is Documentation -->
        <section>
            <h2>What is Documentation?</h2>
            <p><b>Documentation is what gives the software you write a voice.</b> Code can be leveraged to do incredible things. However, even in the most readable of programming languages, code cannot easily:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><small>Tell a potential user what they can gain by using your software</small></li>
                <li><small>Fully brief a contributor on how to set up the correct development environment and deploy the backend properly</small></li>
                <li><small>Convince a hackathon judge that your project is innovative and can have a real-world impact</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Documentation speaks where code can't</b>, so it's important to have at least some resources available for the different types of people that will interact with your project.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Should We Document?</h2>
            <h3>1. You (want to be) using your code in 6 months</h3>
            <p><b>Code written 6 months ago is almost indistinguishable from code written by someone else.</b> If you want to continue iterating on your project after the hackathon, you'll want to be spending time adding new flashy features and making things scalable, <b>not untangling a mess of code that you don't understand or wasting time figuring out how to set up a development environment again</b>.</p>
            <h3>2. You want people to use your code</h3>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, <b>your project's code doesn't do a great job of explaining why it exists</b>. You've written a piece of code and released it into the world because you think it will be useful to others. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><small>If people don't know why your project exists, <b>they won't use it</b></small></li>
                <li><small>If people can't figure out how to install your code, <b>they won't use it</b></small></li>
                <li><small>If people can't figure out how to use your code, <b>they won't use it</b></small></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Documentation is how we ensure our code can be used and appreciated by the world.</p>
            <p><i><small>Note: These points were very heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/">this excellent presentation by Eric Scholscher in 2013</a>.</small></i></p>

            <h2>What Will Our Documentation Look Like?</h2>
            <p>So far, we've been referring to "documentation" as a single entity or thing. However (as you'll soon see on the next page), documentation encompasses a broad variety of things in a variety of forms, that all share the common goal of explaining what your code does, how it's used, or how it can be leveraged.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this guide, there are two places we'll be creating documents: in our project's Git repository and on a <b>dedicated docs site (with it's own repository)</b>.</p>
