*How Do I Docs* is a site that serves as a one-stop shop for hackathon participants to learn what they need to know about documentation.

Too often, hackathon projects are left entirely undocumented, meaning that they can't be easily iterated on after the fact, and good projects don't get the appreciation they would otherwise warrant. While a full suite of documentation, like one would find in a large open-source project, is helpful, it's unrealistic in a "move-fast-break-things" setting like a hackathon. **As such, I wanted to curate a resource that not only encourages hackathon participants to document their projects, but provides a slimmed down subset of templates and concepts as well as a simple starting point to make adding a docs website to a project easy**.


## Who this project is for

This site is a perfect resource for developers in time-constrained settings, like hackathons, that aren't familiar with documenting projects and want a simple resource that provides clear directions for getting from zero to bare minimum


## What this site is built on

This site is written with good old HTML and CSS, themed wth my heavily modified version of [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
