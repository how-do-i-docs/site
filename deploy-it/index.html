            <h1>Deploy It!</h1>
            <p>Now that we know what we're going to write, it's time to put it all together into docs for your project!</p>
            <p>This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of Git and GitHub, as well as how to write/edit documents in Markdown (it's not hard, don't worry).</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Set up Docs Site -->
        <section>
            <h2>Step 1: Set up your docs site</h2>
            <p>To make our docs today, we're going to be utilizing a <b>template repository</b> on GitHub. This template repository is a version of <a href="https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/">Just the Docs</a> populated with the templates outlined on the previous page, meaning it'll just take editing a few files to be up and running with a modern and responsive documentation website.</p>
            <p>Navigate to the link below and click the green "Use this template" button. This will create a copy of the repository that will serve as the home for your documentation</p>
            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/how-do-i-docs/just-the-docs-template">Get the Template ↓</a></b></p>
            <p>This repository has GitHub Actions that automatically build the site, meaning that <b>whenever you commit a change to the documentation repository, it automatically rebuilds the site with the new changes</b>. The site is then served to the internet via GitHub Pages for free. To activate this, head to your new repository's settings, go to the <i>Pages</i> section, then make sure that under <i>Build and Deployment</i>, <b><i>Source</i> is set to Github Actions</b>.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Site Configuration -->
        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Configure the Site</h2>
            <p>To make the newly copied template site your own, you need to make a few changes to some files.</p>
            <p>The first is <code>_config.yml</code>, a file that holds basic configuration data about your site. Make sure to change the title, description, and the url to match the details for your project.</p>
            <p>Second of all, there's a Markdown file called `index.md` in the repository. This is the first page that anyone visiting the documentation site will see, so make sure it's nice, friendly, and has links to useful information</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Populate the Site -->
        <section>
            <h2>Populate the Site</h2>
            <p>Now that the setup is out of the way, we can get to writing! <b>Utilize the templates provided as part of the template, as well as the resources linked in <a href="/dive-deeper">Dive Deeper</a>, to build a few docs</b>. It may not be the most dense and information heavy documentation site, but remember that having some docs is a lot better than having none.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Write the README -->
        <section>
            <h2>The README</h2>
            <p>Next up is the README. This belongs at the root of your project's main GitHub page, and <b>will show up whenever someone visits your project on GitHub</b>. Utilize the template linked below, as well as the resources linked in <a href="/dive-deeper">Dive Deeper</a>, to create a professional-looking README.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Pat yourself on the back -->
        <section>
            <h2>Pat Yourself on the Back</h2>
            <p>If you've made it this far, congrats! You should have a documentation site up and running with a few docs you can build on later, as well as a clean and professional README. You're all set to show the world just how cool your project is!</p>
